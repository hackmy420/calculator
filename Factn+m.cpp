Pak Chanek has a prime number† n. Find a prime number m such that n+m is not prime.

† A prime number is a number with exactly 2 factors. The first few prime numbers are 2,3,5,7,11,13,…. In particular, 1 is not a prime number.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.

The only line of each test case contains a prime number n (2≤n≤105).

Output
For each test case, output a line containing a prime number m (2≤m≤105) such that n+m is not prime. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such m always exists.

If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

Note
In the first test case, m=2, which is prime, and n+m=7+2=9, which is not prime.

In the second test case, m=7, which is prime, and n+m=2+7=9, which is not prime.

In the third test case, m=47837, which is prime, and n+m=75619+47837=123456, which is not prime.
